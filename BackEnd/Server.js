This story would translate well to film. But copy editors, please please catch common misspellings! (ad nauseum instead of ad nauseam).",

Oh, how I would love to be at Weyward Cottage with the garden and the wildlife. The author seamlessly wove together three generations of women who had never met- it read so smoothly! There was a rhythm to the storytelling; it ebbed and flowed just as the beck. Oh, how I wish for a sequel. Emilia Hart is now on my list of favorite authors! Absolutely marvelous book!",
